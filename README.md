# Spring2018Database

# Key-Value Assignment

## Instalation
In order for you to run this program you need to clone or download the files in the folder Key_value_DB


## Requirements
You need to have Java installed on your system so you can compile and execute the files from the command line

## Usage
1. Open a Terminal, navigate to the folder where you clone or downloaded the files.

2. In the same folder as where your Main.java file is located you write: javac filename (javac Main.java)

3. You can then write to the database by doing the following
  - java Main "Key" "Value" (java Main 42 "This is a long string containing data")

4. You can read from the database by doing the following
  - java Main "Key" (java Main 42) This will print the data saved with that key to the terminal
